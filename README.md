# Build-Your-Own-Network

The main objective of this project is to create an online community, designed
to make your social life more active and stimulating. This social network can
help you maintain existing relationships with people and share pictures and
messages, and establish new ones by reaching out to people you've never
met before. This website provides the features of keeping intact with one and
all at one place. A user first creates a profile and add his/her personal and
professional details. User can search for friends and send a friend request to
anyone user wishes to connect with. User can also accept or reject friend
requests. User can post pictures, videos which can be viewed only by user's
friends. They can also chat with their friends. Users can like and comment
their friendâ€™s posts. Java(JSP) is used for the project's interactive interface
and HTML is used for designing front end of the site. This website helps users
to maintain their social aura by keeping intact with their close ones and
important people.

I have used HTML,CSS and javascript for the front end. MySql for the backend and JDBC for connecting the apis to database. I have used firebase for media upload.

#  Front-end: HTML, CSS,JS,JSP
